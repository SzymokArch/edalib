Just a fun attempt at creating a C library with easy to read and implement functions concerning dynamic arrays
I'm not really good at C memory managment (or the C language in general, I'm just a first year computer science student) so I wanted to make my life easier and make a library for managing dynamically allocated arrays.
The functions found here may be inneficient but they're not really meant to be the best solutions. They're just meant to be understadable to even complete beginners in the C language.

I don't really know what else to say, cheers.
