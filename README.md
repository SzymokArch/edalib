Just a fun attempt at creating a C library with easy to read and implement functions concerning dynamic arrays
I'm not really good at C memory managment so I wanted to make my life easier and make a library for managing dynamically allocated arrays.
The functions found here may be inneficient but they're not really meant to be the best solutions. 
They're meant to be understadable to even complete beginners in the C language.
If you somehow stumbled into this repo, then cheers
